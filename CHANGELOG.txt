14 Aug. 2014 update from version 1.0.3.2 to version  1.1

- changed vbap to allocate memory dynamically, to eliminate crash-producing memory overwrites when larger speaker configurations were defined (e.g. on OSX for speakers >  13 in 3D)   z.settel
- eliminated a post to the console reporting azimuth updates
